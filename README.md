 This (loving) tribute to the [Swedish DJ Avicii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii) and the southern California pizza chain [Ameci's Pizza & Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii) was created to fulfill the requirements of my [Epicodus](www.epicodus.com) intermediate JavaScript code review project.
